# FinOps Core Principles

*Published: April 20, 2025 | 15 min read*

## Introduction to FinOps

Financial Operations (FinOps) is a cloud financial management discipline that brings financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud. It creates a shared responsibility model where engineering, finance, and business teams collaborate to make data-driven spending decisions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Team Collaboration
- Break down silos between engineering, finance, and business teams
- Establish cross-functional FinOps teams
- Foster a culture of cost awareness

### 2. Business Value Focus
- Align cloud spending with business objectives
- Measure and optimize unit economics
- Balance cost, quality, and speed

### 3. Centralized Governance
- Implement consistent policies and standards
- Enforce tagging and resource organization
- Establish cost allocation models

### 4. Variable Cost Model
- Adapt to the pay-as-you-go nature of cloud
- Implement showback/chargeback mechanisms
- Optimize for variable workloads

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Inform Phase
- Cost visibility and allocation
- Benchmarking and baselining
- Anomaly detection

### 2. Optimize Phase
- Resource right-sizing
- Commitment-based discounts
- Automation of cost controls

### 3. Operate Phase
- Continuous improvement
- Policy as code
- Financial governance

## Best Practices

### Cost Allocation
- Implement consistent tagging strategy
- Use resource naming conventions
- Track costs by business unit, project, and team

### Budget Management
- Set budget thresholds and alerts
- Implement budget forecasting
- Regular cost reviews

### Optimization Strategies
- Rightsizing recommendations
