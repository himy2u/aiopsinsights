# Tools & FinOps

Making informed decisions about your cloud infrastructure and costs. We provide in-depth reviews of tools and frameworks, along with financial operations (FinOps) strategies to optimize your cloud spending.

## Tool Reviews

### Cloud Platforms
- [AWS Cost Optimization Tools](aws-cost-optimization.md)
- [GCP Cost Management](gcp-cost-management.md)
- [Azure Cost Control](azure-cost-control.md)

### Monitoring & Optimization
- [Datadog vs. New Relic](datadog-vs-newrelic.md)
- [Kubernetes Cost Management](k8s-cost-management.md)

## FinOps Framework

### Core Principles
1. **Visibility** - Understand your cloud spend
2. **Accountability** - Allocate costs to teams and projects
3. **Optimization** - Continuously improve efficiency
4. **Governance** - Implement policies and guardrails
